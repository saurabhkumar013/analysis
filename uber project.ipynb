The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis.\n","\n","A simple example of Data analysis is whenever we take any decision in our day-to-day life is by thinking about what happened last time or what will happen by choosing that particular decision. This is nothing but analyzing our past or future and making decisions based on it. For that, we gather memories of our past or dreams of our future. So that is nothing but data analysis.

In such cases, we should double-check for correct data with data guardians. Some hashing procedures can also be used to make sure data extraction is correct. Errors at data extraction stage are typically easy to find and can be corrected easily as well(error at the time of data extraction that could be fixed easily).\n"," \n"," **(2)-Data collection:** These errors occur at time of data collection and are harder to correct. They can be categorized in four types:\n","\n","* **Missing completely at random**: This is a case when the probability of missing variable is same for all observations. \n"," **For example**: respondents of data collection process decide that they will declare their earning after tossing a fair coin. If an head occurs, respondent declares his / her earnings & vice versa. Here each observation has equal chance of missing value.\n","\n","*   **Missing at random**: This is a case when variable is missing at random and missing ratio varies for different values / level of other input variables. **For example**: We are collecting data for age and female has higher missing value compare to male.\n","* **Missing that depends on unobserved predictors**: This is a case when the missing values are not random and are related to the unobserved input variable. **For example**: In a medical study, if a particular diagnostic causes discomfort, then there is higher chance of drop out from the study. This missing value is not at random unless we have included “discomfort” as an input variable for all patients.\n","\n","* **Missing that depends on the missing value itself**: This is a case when the probability of missing value is directly correlated with missing value itself.

If you try and use the dates directly, you may not be able to extract meaningful insights from the data. This is because the foot fall is less affected by the day of the month than it is by the day of the week. Now this information about day of week is implicit in your data.
